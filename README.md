<h1 align="center">👋 Hello there, 🚀 Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🛠️ <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=LouisAnders0831&label=Profile%20views&color=0e75b6&style=flat" alt="LouisAnders0831" /></h1>

🛢️ I am an accomplished Full Stack blockchain developer with over 5 years of experience specializing in casino, iGaming, and game development within the blockchain ecosystem. 

🌐 Throughout my career, I have successfully delivered a diverse range of blockchain projects, including NFT platforms, DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEX), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Additionally, I have extensive experience in the development of casino games, P2E (Play-to-Earn) games, and other interactive gaming applications.

📚 As a seasoned full stack software engineer, I have honed my skills in a variety of technologies, including Golang, Cosmos, React.js, Vue.js, and Angular. My proficiency extends to essential tools such as hardhat, ethers, TypeScript, and Git. Notably, I have successfully led the migration of projects from Truffle to Hardhat, employed ethers for rigorous unit testing, and adeptly modified Solidity code to enhance project functionality.

🚀 With a comprehensive understanding of blockchain tooling and fundamentals, I am eager to undertake the development of intricate contracts related to DAO and DeFi. My seniority in the field and rich experience in blockchain technology and game development positions me to make substantial contributions to cutting-edge initiatives.
